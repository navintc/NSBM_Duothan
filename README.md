# Backend 

## Development of the backend

#### Laravel - Backend Framework
The development of the backend was carried out using the PHP backend framework Laravel. 

## Database Implementation and Operations 

#### Database Implementation - Migrations
The database implementation was carried out using Migrations to create the databases and tables. Laravel seeders were used to populate the databse with initial testing data to asses that the functionallity of the database was in line with the program.  

#### Database Operations - Laravel ORM
Database operations in the system are carried out using Laravel Eloquent ORM from the core Laravel framework.

## Authorization of Pharmacists (By Admins)
The problem statement for the hackathon stated that an authentication method must be in place for the authentication of Pharmacies registering to the system. The way we implemented this authentication process is by giving admins access to a changeable integer value for every registered Pharmacy. Admins can change this integer value to authenticate and allow Pharmacies to use the Pharmacy dashboard. 

## Security - Data Validation
The overall security of the application was fortified using hashing techniques as well as input validation done on the backend.

# Front End

## React Bootstrap & Routers
To develop the main UI/UX that went into the final system. We used general React Bootstrap for the interfaces styling and UI elements. React routers were also used to give the application routing capabilities.
